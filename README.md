# plugin-preview
Enter a WordPress plugin's repository slug (the bit after https://wordpress.org/plugins/), and press enter. This will open the WordPress Playground, with the plugin installed and ready.

This feature was launched on wordpress.org, but quickly withdrawn later. It appears not to work with network (multisite) plugins or plugins that use AJAX. There may be other limitations, but it's a wonderful tool when it does work.

## Usage
Download or clone the code, and open index.html in a modern browser.
